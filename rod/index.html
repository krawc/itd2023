        Make-believe. Believed in, then made.  Carved from the hardships of the present. A mirror reflecting the power of collective belief. The ultimate battleground.  Tense. Quite terrifying. Really, really hot.  Melting metal.  Melting water.  Liquid.   Quantum. Female.Nonbinary. Immaterial. (Thank you SOPHIE). Synthetic at the edges, organic at the core.   A consolidation of metrics. Whatever you please! Written by a contractor for 2 dollars an hour. Flushed, regurgitated and pumped through neural layers, like a rotten banana through sewage, to the river, to the sea, and back to the art gallery. Autogenerated, sorry.  In us. Preserved for those who still have restraint. In favor of the brave. Courage to change the things you can, and to accept the things you cannot have. Wisdom to tell the difference.  Not a pretty visualization. Not built on AutoCAD.  A game.  Not a simulation.
